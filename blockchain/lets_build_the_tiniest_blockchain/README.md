## Dependencies

- flask

## Summary 

A very simple and naive implementation of some mechanisms in a POW blockchain.
Very useful for a broad introduction and understanding.

Does not implement balance checking when submitting transactions.

`chain.py` is a simple locally running chain without transaction data, while `txion-pow.py` is a node with transaction capabilities that can run with other nodes.
