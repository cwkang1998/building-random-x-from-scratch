# A python interpreter written in python

[Referenced tutorial](http://aosabook.org/en/500L/a-python-interpreter-written-in-python.html)

## Notes

The simple interpreter works, but the byterun example isn't working, and the tutorial doesn't really tell me how I should execute it.

However, the byterun code produced by going through the tutorial would remain here as a reference for myself.
